    /*This project was a great way to practice everything I’ve learned in class. 
    I got to work with forms, validate and sanitize input in PHP, and save data securely using PDO and phpAdmin. 
    I also practiced organizing my code with includes for headers, footers 
    and styling everything nicely with bootstrap. 
    Overall, it helped me understand how to build a web application with php, html and sql.*/
